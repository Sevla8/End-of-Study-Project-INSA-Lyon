	abstract="The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem that can be described as follows: given a fleet of vehicles with uniform capacity, a common depot, and several requests by the customers, find a route plan for the vehicles with overall minimum route cost (eg. distance traveled by vehicles), which service all the demands. It is well known that multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) based algorithms can also be utilized in several VRPs by incorporating some additional constraints, it can be considered as a relaxation of the VRP, with the capacity restrictions removed. The mTSP is a generalization of the well known traveling salesman problem (TSP), where more than one salesman is allowed to be used in the solution. Because of the fact that TSP is already a complex, namely an NP-hard problem, heuristic optimization algorithms, like genetic algorithms (GAs) need to be taken into account. The extension of classical GA tools for mTSP is not a trivial problem, it requires special, interpretable encoding and genetic operators to ensure efficiency. The aim of this chapter is to review how genetic algorithms can be applied to solve these problems, and propose a novel, easily interpretable and problem-oriented representation and operators, that can easily handle constraints on the tour lengths, and the number of salesmen can vary during the evolution. The elaborated heuristic algorithm is demonstrated by a complete realistic example.",

	abstract = {The inspection of sizeable plate-based metal structures such as storage tanks or marine vessel hulls is a significant stake in the industry, which necessitates reliable and time-efficient solutions. Although Lamb waves have been identified as a promising solution for long-range non-destructive testing, and despite the substantial progress made in autonomous navigation and environment sensing, a Lamb-wave-based robotic system for extensive structure monitoring is still lacking. Following previous work on ultrasonic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), we introduce a method to achieve plate geometry inference without prior knowledge of the material propagation properties, which may be lacking during a practical inspection task in challenging and outdoor environments. Our approach combines focalization to adjust the propagation model parameters and beamforming to infer the plate boundaries location by relying directly on acoustic measurements acquired along the mobile unit trajectory. For each candidate model, the focusing ability of the corresponding beamformer is assessed over high-pass filtered beamforming maps to further improve the robustness of the plate geometry estimates. We then recover the optimal space-domain beamformer through a simulated annealing optimization process. We evaluate our method on three sets of experimental data acquired in different conditions and show that accurate plate geometry inference can be achieved without any prior propagation model. Finally, the results show that the optimal beamformer outperforms the beamformer resulting from the predetermined propagation model in non-nominal acquisition conditions.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on impact localization of composite structures, which possess more complexity in the guided wave propagation due to the anisotropic behavior of composite materials. In this work, a composite plate was manufactured by using a compression molding process with proper pressure and temperature cycle. Eight layers of woven composite prepreg were used to manufacture the composite plate. A structural health monitoring (SHM) technique was implemented with piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) to detect and localize the impact on the plate. There were two types of impact event that were considered in this paper (a) low energy impact event (b) high energy impact event. Two clusters of sensors recorded the guided acoustic waves generated from the impact. The acoustic signals were then analyzed using a wavelet transform based time-frequency analysis. The proposed SHM technique successfully detected and localized the impact event on the plate. The experimentally measured impact locations were compared with the actual impact locations. An immersion ultrasonic scanning method was used to visualize the composite plate before and after the impact event. A high frequency 10 MHz 1-inch focused transducer was used to scan the plate in the immersion tank. Scanning results showed that there was no visible manufacturing damage in the composite plate. However, clear impact damage was observed after the high-energy impact event.},

Guided wave tomography is a solution which allows an area to be imaged with data from an array of ultrasonic transducers around the defect, using tomographic methods to establish wall thickness. We exploit the dispersive nature of Lamb waves travelling through the wall to convert the thickness variation into wave velocity variations, providing a mechanism to determine thickness from a velocity reconstruction. HARBUT (the Hybrid Algorithm for Robust Breast Ultrasound Tomography) has been developed to give high-resolution, accurate and robust reconstructions of ultrasonic velocity through the breast; in this paper we extend the method to generate thickness maps for guided wave tomography. By iterating HARBUT we show that we can improve the accuracy of reconstructions of the small, high contrast defects expected from corrosion, allowing estimates of thicknesses within 1 mm for a 10 mm plate from both simulated and experimental data.}

	abstract = {The inspection and maintenance of large-scale industrial structures are major challenges that require time-efficient and reliable solutions to ensure the healthy condition of structures during operation. Autonomous robots may provide a promising solution for this purpose. In particular, they could lead to faster and more reliable inspection and maintenance without direct intervention from human operators. In this paper, we present a custom magnetic crawler system, and sensor suit and sensing modalities to enable such robotic operation. We first describe a localization framework based on a mesh created from a point cloud coupled with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) readings. Next, we introduce a mapping framework that relies on a 3D laser, and explicitly state how autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance can be developed. Lastly, we present how ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) are integrated into the system to provide accurate robot localization and structural feature mapping by relying on acoustic reflections in combination with the other systems. It is envisioned that long-range inspection capabilities that are not yet available in current industrial mobile platforms could emerge from the designed robotic system.},
